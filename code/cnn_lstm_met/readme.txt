The model described in file cnn_lstm_pm25_met_sw.py uses met data at Liverpool as well as PM2.5 data at 4 stations (Liverpool, Bringelly, Campbelltown West and Camden) produces some evaluation csv files

These evaluation files (cnn_lstm_predictions.csv, cnn_lstm_mae.csv) are used by app_pm25_met_cnn_lstm_72.py to display interactively the results
